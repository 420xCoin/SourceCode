Even if 420X looks like a meme token, there is a lot more to it. While it is true, we launched on 4/20/2021 which is the best day in the year, our mission is far beyond that.
Our immediate goal is to unite every community possible and break down every barrier dividing humans and unite on something we can all agree on, memes. 
We have spent countless hours speaking to every single one of you, and it would honor us to spend countless more. 
We do not believe in the word “different” here and we plan to give back to charities to help make the world a tiny bit better.
